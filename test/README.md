# OMG Web Flasher

WebFlasher is a WebSerial based tool designed to download user requested firmware from the official repository store and flash it onto the users O.MG Device. 

Currently only *Google Chrome* and *Microsoft Edge* are supported, as more browsers support WebSerial we can add support to those browsers.


This release implements an entirely new control structure for flashing and handling of flash data from the device. Currently it is based on Bootstrap 5 with minimal external JS libraries (such as popper.js)
